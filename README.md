# Superhero and Vehicles Python Project

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Python.

## Project Structure
- `Superhero` class represents a basic superhero.
- `FlyingSuperhero` class inherits from `Superhero` and adds flight capability.
- `Vehicle` is a base class for various types of vehicles.
- `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` classes each override the `move()` method to demonstrate polymorphism.
